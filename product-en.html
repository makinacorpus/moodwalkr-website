                <p>MoodWalkR was designed to explore all routes, big and small. All walks are calculated from the point of view of a pedestrian, taking into account crosswalks, particularly steep areas, and any other potentially interesting surrounding elements. It could, for example, urge you to cross a square or wander through a vibrant area !  </p>
                <h4 class="title title--medium title--medium-orange">Personalize the base map</h4>
